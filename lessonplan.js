// AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

// AJAX uses a combo of 
// + A browser built -in XMLHttpRequest object(to request data from a web server)
// + JavaScript and HTML DOM(to display or use the data)

// 1. An event occurs in a web page(the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
// 2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
// 3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
// 4. The server processes the request
// 5. The server sends a response back to the web page
// 6. The response is read by JavaScript
// 7. Proper action(like page update) is performed by JavaScript

// API key is necessary for you to access certain closed sources. There are some APIs that do /not/ require an API key. 

// Postman can be as simple as you want it to be. You could do a "GET" request on wikipedia.com, and it would return something. Play around!

// PROMISES to handle async code

// Promise objects have three states
// 1. Pending - The object's initial state. A pending operation ha sbeen started, but not completed. 
// 2. Fulfilled - A promise is fulfilled when the operation has been successfully completed.
// 3. Rejected -A promise is rejected is when the operation fails for some reason.
